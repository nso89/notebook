# Notebook
Code snippets and notes to remember.

Consider this like a your high school or college notebook. It isn't well structured (no table of contents for each section), and most of it will probably be confusing if you're new to `Python` or `Ballerina`.

If a section becomes more elaborate and well written, I'l most likely move it and a well structured repository for easier navigation and reading.
