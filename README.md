# Notebook
Code snippets and notes to remember.

Consider this like a your high school or college notebook. It isn't well structured (no table of contents for each section), and most of it will probably be confusing if you're new to `Python` or `Ballerina`. The topics aren't limited to just programming, so you'll find snippets about random things. For example, astronomy, math, computer tips and shortcuts. 

If a section becomes more elaborate and well written, I'll most likely move it to a well structured repository for easier navigation and reading.
