In one of my favorite episodes of friends, Rachel gets a kiss from her sorority sister,
Melissa,  and  we  learn that she's in love with Rachel.  One point to keep in mind, we 
shouldn't  look  to Friends to adequately dive into LGTBQ relationships. It did have an 
episode titled "The One with the Lesbian Wedding", but the two characters aren't the 
primary characters of the show.

The  only  problem I have with this episode is Joey, more specifically his behavior. He 
bothers Rachel about the kiss,  and  even  offers  to go to dinner with Rachel with his 
video camera. I  fully  understand,  this  is  who Joey is, your immature, but reliable 
friend for life.   

I could have done without Joey's lines in this plot.  It  would would have been nice to 
explore if  Rachel  wanted to purse a relationship with Melissa. Perhaps in a "what if" 
situation, like they did in The One That Could Have Been, Part 1 & 2. 

After exiting the restaurant,  it  could  play  out  as it did, but Rachel realizes she 
needs more time to reflect,  and  we  could  have  a  moment where she calls Melissa to 
meet at the coffee house, perhaps to explore what could happen.
